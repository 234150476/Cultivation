# Troubleshooting
A guide dedicated for trying to troubleshoot Cultivation.

## The launcher doesn't appear to open.
Try running the launcher with **administrative privileges**.\
If this fixes your issue, you can force enable it in the **Compatability**\
tab for the launcher's executable.

## Unable to play on `localhost`.
Make sure your server is running with **encryption disabled**.\
Additionally, make sure Cultivation **is not using HTTPS**.

## "I can't do anything requiring the internet after closing Cultivation!"
You probably didn't close Cultivation properly.\
Go to your *Windows Settings*, then *Network*, then *Proxy*, then disable it.
